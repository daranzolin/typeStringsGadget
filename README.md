# typeStringsGadget

This gadget was born from a combination of (1) frustration; (2) laziness, (3) the encouragement of one Dean Attali; 
and (4) the abiding genius of RStudio's dev team.

# What does it do?

`typeStringsGadget` is a shiny gadget that allows you to type strings unencumbered. For example, if you need to type a long vector of strings,
you don't have to wrap each individual string in quotation marks. You can even paste text from elsewhere into the textbox, and the gadget
will convert it to a character or numeric vector.

# Installation

```
devtools::install_github("daranzolin/typeStringsGadget")
